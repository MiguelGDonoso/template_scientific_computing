Choose a self-explaining name for your project. Simple overview of use/purpose.


***********
Description
***********

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors. Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

************
Installation
************

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10
* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

::

   bash
   pip install foobar


*****
Usage
*****

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
* Screenshots, features

.. code-block:: python

   import foobar

   foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
   foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
   foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
